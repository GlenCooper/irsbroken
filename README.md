irs.gov website is unable to accept logins so often that I cannot make payments to them online

20250812T170939Z: I am creating a github repo to document the times where I try to log into https://irs.gov to make a payment on my back taxes, but am unable to log into their website because their website says "Your request could not be completed".  This has happened so many times that to me recently that I thought I should start documenting all of the times it happens, and do so in a way that is provable that it occurred.  I know of no better way than to do so in an open-source fashion using github.com so that's why I have created this repository.  It seems absurd that they are charging me interest on overdue payments when I cannot even log into their website to pay them anything.  Not only absurd, it seems criminal.

20250813T013945Z: I thought to try a Firefox Private browser instea of my normal Firefox browser.  It worked.  I was able to log in successfully after verifying my phone number.  I made a payment successfully.  Social Security should fix whatever problem I was encountering so it's not just that generic broken message.  I'm probably not the only one who's receiving that failed login attempt message.  Not everyone else would think to try a different browser.  There should at least be an error message that makes sense instead of "We apologize but there seems to be an issue completing your request. Please try again in a few minutes."  

20250819T094454Z: maybe I just got lucky last time when I tried a firefox private browser and it let me in.  Tried again just now.  It said I was using an incorrect password.  I am certain I was using the correct password; I saved it in my firefox passwords, and saved it to my KeePassXC password manager.  I had the same password saved to both.  The IRS website said the password was incorrect.  Fine, whatever.  I changed it.  It said it changed it successfully.  Now when attempting to log in, it's giving a different error message;
