irs.gov website is unable to accept logins so often that I cannot make payments to them online

20250812T170939Z: I am creating a github repo to document the times where I try to log into https://irs.gov to make a payment on my back taxes, but am unable to log into their website because their website says "Your request could not be completed".  This has happened so many times that to me recently that I thought I should start documenting all of the times it happens, and do so in a way that is provable that it occurred.  I know of no better way than to do so in an open-source fashion using github.com so that's why I have created this repository.  It seems absurd that they are charging me interest on overdue payments when I cannot even log into their website to pay them anything.  Not only absurd, it seems criminal.
